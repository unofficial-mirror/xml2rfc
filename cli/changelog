xml2rfc (2.10.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  This bugfix release works around a problem with lxml versions before 3.8.0,
  and brings some other fixes and tweaks:

  * Tweaked validation output to not break if validation error log elements
    lack xpath information. Fixes issue #376.  (lxml<3.8.0 does not provide
    the xpath of the offending element in error.path).

  * Tweaked the rendering of <eref>.

  * Added <blockquote> to the list of block level elements in isblock().

  * Added some values to xml2rfc.base.default_options, necessary when using 
    xml2rfc as a library module (i.e., not getting options from run.py through 
    command-line invocation).

  * Added attribute markers="true"|"false" to <sourcecode> and changed the v3
    text formatter to only output code markers if <sourcecode> has attribute
    markers set to true.

xml2rfc (2.10.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added a full listing of validation errors found, rather than just the
    first, when running v3 validation on an (possibly v2v3 converted) input
    file in preptool.  Also improved the error messages by providing the xpath
    to the offending element.

  * Added normalization of RFC 2119 phrases before checking for validity, and
    updated tests files to include a <bcp14> test.

  * Fixed several places where unexpected input could cause exceptions.  
    Also turned the invalid input document warning into an error.  Fixes issue 
    #375.

  * Preserved the element tail when rendering <bcp14>.  Fixes issue #374.

  * Fixed an issue where an empty <references/> section could cause an 
    exception in the v2 text formatter.

xml2rfc (2.10.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is primarily a bugfix release, to handle issues people have reported
  with the new vocabulary v3 text formatter:

  * Fixed an issue where the v2 text formatter could blow up for some v3
    documents, rather than exit with a message.

  * Fixed a problem in the v2v3 converter that could cause an Internet-Draft
    <seriesInfo> element to be inserted even if one was alredy present.

  * Tweaked the <seriesInfo> insertion code slightly, and expanded an error
    message slightly.

  * Fixed a couple of places where bad input could cause exceptions.  Fixes 
    issue #366.

  * Fixed a case where max() could be given an empty sequence.

  * Tweaked the handling of <ul> with structured <li> content.  Fixes issue 
    #365.

  * Improved the handling of <br>.

  * Added render_blockquote().  This fixes issue #359.

  * Fixed a problem in the plaintext formatter where table cells were not 
    filled in if the table was wider than the available width.  Also added 
    support for formatted table cell content.

  * Added a check in preptool for <keyword> elements containing multiple 
    keywords.  Fixes issue #353.

  * Moved the reading of input files to avoid multiple reads.  Fixes issue 
    #352.

  * Added a renderer for <bcp14> elements.

  * Added error messages for empty artwork files.  Tweaked the error 
    message for missing artwork text.  Addresses issue #370

  * Forced no_dtd when running v2v3 to avoid complaints when converting an 
    alredy converted file, and also with the v3 text formatter.

  * Added a try/except around xinclude in order to provide error message  
    without traceback on missing include files.

  * Removed an assert that prevented rendering of document top when some 
    elements are so long that the line width will be more than 72 characters.  
    Added support for <note> with <name>.  Added <xref> format default for 
    included references.  Added a warning for <xref>s without 'pn' attribute 
    (which can happen if the <xref> is pointing at an element for which pn is 
    not generated (this is probably an error in RFC 7998).  Fixes issue #346

  * Tweaked the preptool to handle removeInRFC='true' elements that lacks <t> 
    children.

  * Added xml2rfc-dev@ietf.org to the release notification addresses.

xml2rfc (2.10.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release introduces the vocabulary v3 text formatter.  In order to
  invoke this formatter, use the regular --text switch for text output, and
  add the --v3 switch to specify the v3 text formatter.

  Xml2rfc in v3 text formatter mode accepts any valid xml2rfc input file, but
  since the actual formatter only understands the XML elements and attributes
  which have not been deprecated by RFC7991, it first applies the xml2rfc v2v3
  converter in order to transform any deprecated markup to the elements and
  attributes it understands, and then applies the preptool in order to
  normalize the input before it starts rendering.

  This is the first release of the v3 text formatter, and there are some
  known rough edges and deficiencies:

  - The current table output renders all table borders.  This differs from
    the v2 formatter, and will be remedied in a later release.  The reason
    for doing the first release with this rendering of tables is that the
    table layout options have changed substantially with the possibility of
    using rowspans, and the table layout code is much more complex than for v2
    as a consequence.  With all table borders visible, the initial testing of
    the layout code has been easier than if horizontal borders were not
    rendered.

  - The statement of work for the text formatter coding does not include
    paginated output, and as a consequence the Table of Contents is much less
    informative than it would be if it was able to show the page for each ToC
    entry.

  - The xml2rfc v3 vocabulary (RFC 7991) does not provide 'align' attributes
    for tables, which means that the ability to center and right-align tables
    is lost.  All tables are left-aligned. (Alignment of text within each cell
    is still supported, though.)

  - The index generation (using <iref> elements) has some known issues, which
    will also be fixed in a subsequent release.

  The v3 schema used in this release differs from the schema specified in
  RFC7991 in some respects.  A separate document will be published with
  details about the changes: draft-levkowetz-xml2rfc-v3-implementation-notes.
  The issues leading to the changes will also be entered in the document 
  issue trackers and sent to the xml2rfc-dev mailing list for discussion.

  Feedback on the v3 text formatter will be appreciated.  Please send feedback
  to xml2rfc-dev@ietf.org or henrik@levkowetz.com.

    copyright stanza without year.

  * Tweaked the --version output to include the program name, to be closer 
    to common practice.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Feb 2018 05:19:07 -0800

xml2rfc (2.9.4) ietf; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug in the date output format when no month or numeric month
    is given in <date>.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Feb 2018 14:12:11 -0800

xml2rfc (2.9.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Changed the way <date> defaults are calculated.  Previously, today's
    date were used to populate missing day if month and year matched, and
    to populate month if year matched.  However, if today's date lay in an
    adjoining month, even if it was within days of that month, the day
    would be set to the first of the given month.  This commit changes that,
    to use the last day of the month instead of the first of the month, if
    the month is the previous month to today's date.  This will result in
    a different derived date than earlier, closer to today's date.  This
    fixes issue #337.

  * Fixed a bug in a preptool.py error message.  Reverted a prettyprinting 
    change which caused inconsistent behaviour between writers.

  * Moved normalize_month() to utils, for use in multiple writers.

  * Made the makefile less verbose.

  * Improved the pretty-printing of v2v3 output.  Fixed a bug in the 
    attribute_xref_target() handler name that prevented it from being called.

  * Removed whitespace normalization from v2v3 writer.

  * Moved handling of exempted default attributes in preptool inside 
    get_attribute_defaults(), for consistency.

  * Added an option --liberal to permit re-processing of prepped source 
    without error exit.  This mode will be needed when we make the preptool 
    part of the default processing pipeline.  Also removed whitespace 
    normalization for v2v3, exp, and preptool output, in order to not change 
    authors' text formatting when not needed.

  * Lowered the requirement on six to 1.4.1 in order to make installation
    easier on some systems with locked system python libs that include six.

xml2rfc (2.9.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Fixed issues with packaging and with execution under python 2.7.  
    Fixes issue #342 and #343.

xml2rfc (2.9.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release introduces preptool functionality, through a --preptool output
  mode.  With reservation for some points for which issues has been raised,
  this follows the spedicfication in RFC7998.

  The preptool currently takes vocabulary v3 input, and produces prepped
  output.  When work on the text formatter commences, the idea is that the
  input xml source will always be run through v2v3 conversion and preptool
  processing before the output formatting, in order to increase consistency
  and reduce complexity of the output formatter.

  There are also some changes which are not related to the preptool
  functionality: The tox tests have been changed to add testing under Python
  3.6, and removed test runs for Python 3.3.  Although there is no intention
  of breaking compatibility with Python 3.3, it may happen eventually since
  there will not be any release testing with that version of Python.

  The v2v3 converter in some cases could insert <seriesInfo> elements with
  only a name= attribute, because the required seriesNo= attribute on <rfc>
  was missing.  This has been changed.

  In order to work around a debilitating issue with relax-ng validation in
  libxml2 (time to validate increases exponentially with number of attributes
  on the root element: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133736)
  some empty attributes on <rfc> are removed during processing; for instance
  obsoletes="" and updates="".  They don't contribute information, but
  increase validation time with a factor ~20.

  In order to identify the unicode scripts needed to display a document,
  a module to efficiently identify the scripts related to unicode codepoints
  has been written.  The 'uniscripts' module which was originally intended to
  be used for this turned out not to be viable.  The new 'scripts' module can
  be broken out for separate release as a library module, if desired.

  In order to work with vocabulary v3 input, the parser has been slightly
  modified to not do input validation according to rfc2629.dtd if not
  appropriate.

xml2rfc (2.8.5) ietf; urgency=low

  * Changed a file open under python3 to use the newline= parameter to open()
    instead of the deprecated 'U' mode (thanks to spf2@kitterman.com for
    pointing that out).  Also changed the code to avoid a dangling open file
    handle.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Jan 2018 11:47:41 -0800

xml2rfc (2.8.4) ietf; urgency=low

  * Included test.py and tox.ini in the package MANIFEST in order to make 
    testing possible during distro packaging.  Fixes issue #339.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Jan 2018 11:08:01 -0800

xml2rfc (2.8.3) ietf; urgency=low

  * Changed the python 3 code that reads in an xml file to read as binary, 
    in order to not run into issues with unicode conversion before we have had 
    time to look at the encoding attribute of the <xml/> element.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Jan 2018 05:27:31 -0800


xml2rfc (2.8.2) ietf; urgency=low

  * Modified the V2v3 conversion writer to work with generic lxml.etree
    instances.

  * Fixed a failure that could occur for hanging style lists without hangText
    attributes.

  * Tweaked mkrelease to work without the old tools control files and tools 
    feeds being present.

xml2rfc (2.8.1) ietf; urgency=low

  This release improves the v2 to v3 conversion of <artwork/> elements
  which contains <CODE BEGINS>; these are now converted to <sourcecode/>

xml2rfc (2.8.0) ietf; urgency=low

  This is a small feature release which changes URLs in boilerplate to
  use https: instead of http:.  There are also some bugfixes.

  * Include notes when doing index processing.  Fixes issue #335.

  * Include erefs with text equal to the URL in the URIs section.  See 
    issue #334.

  * Changed the use of http: to https: in many places.  In the generation 
    of RFCs, the code uses a switchover date of August 21, 2017 when deciding 
    whether to insert http: or https: URLs.  In practice, this means that RFCs 
    with a date of September 2017 or later will get https:.  Also fixed URL 
    line-breaking prevention to apply to https: URLS.  Fixes issue #333.

  * In urlkeep(), prevent breaking also for https:, not only http: URLs

xml2rfc (2.7.0) ietf; urgency=low

  This introduces the vocabulary v2 to v3 converter, which reads
  RFC7749-compliant xml input, and writes RFC7991-compliant xml output,
  converting elements marked as deprecated in RFC7991 to the equivalent new
  constructs, or removing attributes and elements if no equivalent construct
  exists.  Use the format switch --v2v3 to request v2v3 conversion.  Use
  --verbose to have comments added to the converted xml detailing the
  conversions which have been done.

xml2rfc (2.6.2) ietf; urgency=low

  * Refactored the input file reading to accept files with Mac line 
    endings, using python's Universal Newline support.  This should make 
    xml2rfc deal correctly with input files following DOS, MAC and Linux 
    line-ending conventions.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Jun 2017 06:26:58 -0700

xml2rfc (2.6.1) ietf; urgency=low

  * Inialised the widow and orphan limit settings from PIs.  Did some related
    refactoring.

  * Added an option to show the known PIs, and their default values.  Also
    commented out PIs for which there are no implementations from the internal
    PI list, and did some refactoring of the option parser setup.

  * Changed a number of numeric constants related to page breaking which
    occured inline in the code, so that appropriate settings on the writer are
    used instead: self.page_end_blank_lines, self.orphan_limit,
    self.widow_limit.  Some refactoring.

  * Restored support for the quiet= argument to writers, as this is used by
    other tools that invoke writers, and backwards compatibility is desired.

  * Added a mkrelease script.

  * Limited the changelog on the pypi page to the 2 latest releases.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Jun 2017 08:14:07 -0700


xml2rfc (2.6.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  * The implementation of the 'authorship' PI in the original TCL tool would
    suppress the Author's Address section when set to "no", while in the
    current implementation it removed author information on the first page.
    Changed to the original semantics.  Also author organisation handling on
    the first page changed to use the submissionType setting to trigger the
    behaviour described in issue #311.  Fixes issue #311 without overlaying
    this on the 'authorship' PI.

  * Added a check for the 'needLines' PI within lists.

  * Fixed a bug in the code for the 'sectionorphans' PI. Added a PI
    'tocpagebreak' to force a page break before the ToC.  This, together with
    the fix for #311 and needLines within lists, lets xml2rfc produce
    rfc7754.txt correctly from suitable xml without postprocessing.

  * Tweaked the eref output in text mode to avoid generating extraneous 
    space characters.  Fixes issue #329.

  * Merged in [2251] from ietf@augustcellars.com:
    Changed to use the emph character in spanex so that the same thing happens
    in both html and text if an unknown attribute is given.  Fixes issue #297"

  * Merged in [2250] from ietf@augustcellars.com, with tweaks:
    Added code to emit sections in two sections, numbered and un-numbered,
    separately.  Then emit the numbered appendixes, the index, the unnumbered
    appendixes, cref items, authors at the end of the document.  Fixes issue
    #310.

  * Merged in [2249] from ietf@augustcellars.com:
    If you have an xref or similar element in an annotation in a reference,
    any text that follows the xref is absent from the output HTML file.  Text
    files emit correctly.  Fixed the html generation.

  * Merged in [2248] from ietf@augustcellars.com: 
    The HTML rendering for <xref> elements were inconsistent with the text
    rendering.  Fixed this by doing something completely different than is
    called for in the bug report:

    We follow the layout of what the V3 HTML document says to do.  This
    means that we use the child text of the xref when it exists to the
    exclusion of any generated text.  When the child text does not exist
    then we use the synthesized text string as the text for the anchor
    element.  In all cases the anchor element is emitted with an href of the
    target.  Fixes issue #293.

  * Merged in [2247] from ietf@augustcellars.com:
    Added true and false as legal values for the attribute numbered on a
    section.xml Fixes issue #313

  * Eliminated redundant PI parsing, now that each element carries the local 
    PI settings.

  * Merged in patch from martin.thomson@gmail.com, see ticket #307:
    Fixed a problem where if there are no authors, references in HTML are
    badly formatted.  Fixes issue #307 and #309.

  * Merged in [2215] from ietf@augustcellars.com, with some tweaks to make
    things work under python 3.x:
    Don't split special terms with embedded forward slash on the slash
    character.  Fixes issue #288.  Also added code to deal with an extra tab
    in the middle of a sentence.

  * Changed the handling of PIs such that each element in the parsed xml 
    tree holds the PI state at that point of the xml document.  This provides 
    the ability to use different PI settings at different points in the 
    document.  This only makes sense for some PIs, though.  The following PIs 
    will now be honoured if changed inside the document, in order to provide 
    more flexibility: 'multiple-initials', 'artworkdelimiter', 'compact', 
    'subcompact', 'text-list-symbols', 'colonspace'.

  * Honour the way double initials are given in the XML, with or without 
    interleaved spaces.  See issue #303, which says of multiple initials '... 
    Expectation was that it would exactly match the initials attribute in the 
    XML'

  * Merged in [2070] from ietf@augustcellars.com:
    Enabled the multiple-initial PI again.  The code now also looks for the PI
    as the first element of the author element, to apply for that author entry
    only, with a default of 'no'.

  * Merged in [2064] from ietf@augustcellars.com:
    Added handling for absent author initials for the html generator.

  * Merged in [2062] from ietf@augustcellars.com:
    This commit provides support for multiple author initials.  Fixes issue
    #303.  Also fixes the issue of extra commas showing up when there are no
    initials, just a surname.

  * Merged in [2059] from ietf@augustcellars.com:
    Changet to emit html not xhtml.  Addresses issues #263 and #279.

  * Updated additional test masters needed to make the tox tests pass, and
    changed the html encoding and decoding to use utf-8, to work with the
    unicode and utf-8 tests.

  * Removed python 2.6 from tox texting (a previous commit added python 3.5).

  * Don't let the value of 'title' be None, make it an empty string if that 
    happens.  Fixes issue #328

  * Someone might want to set hangIndent to zero.  Test the value against None
    explicitly to permit this to succeed.

  * Added an --utf8 switch to xml2rfc.  In nroff mode, the output will 
    contain utf-8 characters, not \[u8FD9] escapes; use groff with the -Kutf8 
    switch to process the resulting nroff.

  * Removed all references to xml.resource.org; it is not useful for 
    fallback purposes any more.

xml2rfc (2.5.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  information to refer to RFC 7841 instead of RFC 5741, for RFCs dated
  July 2016 or later.

xml2rfc (2.5.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix maintenance release.

  * Handled a situation where xml2rfc could crash if no source file name
    was available.

  From tonyh@att.com:
  * Modified some tests to match Jim's recent changes

  From ietf@augustcellars.com:

  * Add the valid versions of the text files for the unicode test file.

  * Fixes URIs which didn't add up.  This includes correcting code to deal
    with the difference in unicode strings on Python 2.7 vs Python 3.4.  Build
    the abstract when doing the indexing pass so that any references in it
    will be included both times through Add the start of a unicode test file.
    Fixes issue #290

  * Fixed an xref generation failure: Check to see if there is text, and do
    the right thing if there isn't.  The HTML version seems to be producing
    adequate results.  It does an <a> element around an empty piece of text.
    That is what was asked for.  Fixes issue #226.

  * Fixed an exception on out-of-date dates.  1.  We make it an error instead
    of a warning to have an incomplete and not this year date.  2.  We catch
    the type exception and continue.  Fixes issue #285

  * Replaced the space between the series info and the series value with a
    non-breaking space.  Changed any slashes in the series value so that there
    is a non-breaking zero width space following it.  If a URL is placed in
    the series value, then it is still not going to do correct breaking on
    this.  However this is not something that people should do.  Fixes issue
    #296

xml2rfc (2.5.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release uses different installation settings than previous releases,
  which should make installation under MS Window easier.  It also contains
  a few bugfixes.  For details, see below:

  * Applied patches from julian.reschke@gmx.de: Render <eref target='uri'> 
    without text as inline <uri>.  Fixes issue #234.

  * Changed setup.py to use the entry_points option instead of the scripts 
    option, in order to work better on mswin systems.  Fixes issue #291.

  * Made the reference sorting when using symrefs=yes and sortrefs=yes 
    case-insensitive by mapping the reference keys to lowercase.  This is 
    correct for ASCII keys but not necessarily for non-ASCII keys, depending on 
    locale.  Fixes issue #295 (for now).

  * Changed the path through reference resolution so that too old cached
    references will be updated in the same block where it was discovered that
    they were too old, rather than (erroneously) relying on this happening on
    a later attempt.

  * Set things up so that the processing instrunction dictionary isn't shared
    between the index-building and the document-building runs, which they were
    earlier, with the result that pi values could be different at the start of
    the document-building than they should have been.  Fixes issue #292.

  * Modified the nroff table output for PI subcompact=yes so as to produce 
    a list, rather than a paragraph of run-together list entries.  Fixes issue 
    #287.

  * Fixed a bug where a local variable would not always be set.

  * Fixed the bug in 2.4.10 where xml2rfc wouldn't fetch references.

  * Changed the cachetest so it exposes the bug found in 2.4.10 where 
    reference resulution would fail without even attempting network access.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Apr 2015 17:28:58 +0000

xml2rfc (2.4.11) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Corrected when the deprecation message about using -f and --file is emitted.

  * Changed where warnings about missing cache entry and --no-network is
    emitted, in order to not emit warnings too early.

xml2rfc (2.4.10) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Catch bad arguments to the 'needlines' processing instruction.  Fixes 
    issue #282.

  * Make sure we don't ask textwrap to wrap text with within a width of 
    zero.  Fixes issue #277.

  * Reorganized the presentation of options, and corrected some of the help 
    strings.  Marked the -f, --filename options in use for output filename as 
    deprecated.

  * Added a switch --no-network to turn off all attempts to use the network 
    to resolve references.  When using this, processing will fail if the 
    references required by the source file aren't available in the file cache.  
    Also added code to refresh cached content if it's older than 14 days.  
    Modified some tests to suit.  This closes issues #275 and #284.

  * Fixed a bug where leading whitespace in title attributes weren't 
    handled properly.  Fixes issue #274.

  * Tweaked tox.ini to work around an issue with the py27 and py33 
    environments after upgrading to 2.7.8 and 3.3.5, respectively.

  * Added the attribute quote-title (default: true) to schema and writers, 
    and updated the tests accordingly.  Fixes issue #283.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  08 Mar 2015 20:55:36 +0000


xml2rfc (2.4.9) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Applied a patch from Martin Thompson to render the ToC with sublevel 
    indentation, instead of as a flat list, for html output, and updated the 
    html regression test masters to match.

  * Added a --no-headers switch, valid only for paginated text.  
    Specifying this omits the output of headers and footers, but retains form 
    feed and top-of-page line padding.

  * Consistently use utf-8 as output encoding.  As long as all content is 
    forced to be ascii, this doesn't change anything; if we permit non-ascii 
    content, this ensures it's utf-8 encoded.

  * Issue a warning for input containing tab characters, and expand to 8, 
    not 4 characters.  Fixes issue #276.

  * Added 'i.e.' as a non-sentence-ending string.  Added a test for some 
    abbreviations, including 'i.e.'.  Fixes issue #115

  * Changed the handling of rfcedstyle so as to include the Authors' 
    Addresses section in the TOC.  Fixes issue #273.

  * Added the ability to create unnumbered sections by using the attribute 
    numbered="no" on the section element, with the constraints specified in 
    draft-hoffman-xml2rfc-15.  Fixes issue #105.

  * In the front page top right-hand matter, don't keep the blank line 
    between authors and date that would otherwise be used for authors without 
    affiliation.  Fixes issue #272.

  * Rewrote the network access code to use the requests package instead of 
    urllib.  Added cache cleaning to the tox test actions.

xml2rfc (2.4.8) ietf; urgency=medium

  * From Tony Hansen <tonyh@att.com>:
    Added check of line_num+i against len(self.buf) before looking at
    self.buf[line_num+i].  Resolves issue #258.

  * Tweaked the word separator regex to handle words containing both '.' 
    and '-' internally more correctly. Fixes issue #256.

  * Now only emitting texttable word splitting warning once.

  * Changed the sort order of iref index items to not be case sensitive.  
    Fixes issue #255.

  * Generally, changed http: URLs to https:, for improved security.

xml2rfc (2.4.7) ietf; urgency=high

  This release changes the reference resolution code to try 3 different
  network hosts when trying to find bibxml reference files on the net,
  instead of trying only xml.reference.org.  It now tries, in order::

     http://xml2rfc.ietf.org/
     http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/
     http://xml.reference.org/

  The next release is expected to change this to using https: instead of http:,
  but that change requires both that the resources be available over https,
  and that there's been explicit testing of access over https, something which
  is absent from the current test suite.

xml2rfc (2.4.6) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release addresses the known bugs in xml2rfc which has hindered the
  RFC-Editor staff from consistently using xml2rfc v2 in production (and a
  number of other bugs, too).  There still remains a number of open issues,
  and these will be addressed in upcoming releases.  Here are some details
  about the issues fixed:

  * Tweaked the forward-slash part of the word-separator regex to handle IP 
    address prefix lenght indications better.  Related to issue #252.
    Thanks to Brian Carpenter for pointing this aspect out.

  * Changed the code so as to not blow up on empty section titles.  Fixes
    issue #245.

  * Updated the textwrapping word-separator regex to handle slash-separated
    words in a similar manner as hyphenated words, to avoid line-breaks that
    place the forward slash at the start of a line.  Fixes issue #252.

  * Updated the regex for end-of-sentence exceptions to treat a single
    alphabetic character followed by period as end-of-sentence, rather than
    considering it to be the abbreviation of a given name.  This fixes issue
    #251.

  * Updated the sorting to not sort the ref keys surrounded by squere
    brackest, instead sorting only the key strings.  Fixes issue #250.  

  * Added iref handling directly under section, and for figures, both of which
    were missing previously.  Fixes issue #249.  Also modified the format in
    which iref index page lists are emitted, to combine consecutive page
    numbers into range indications, and eliminate repeat mentions of the same
    page number.  Finally, changed things to avoid compressing the double
    space between index item and page list to a single space.  This should
    bring the iref output closer to that of xml2rfc v1.

  * Removed a static copy of the initial text-list-symbols PI, instead
    consulting the master PI dictionary every time, in order to catch changes
    in the text-list-symbols setting.  Fixes issue #246

  * Made a warning conditional on not building the indexes, to avoid duplicate
    error messages.  Fixes issue #242.

  * Provided the relevant counter when creating _RfcItem objects for Figures,
    Tables, numbered References, and Crefs, to make it possible to refer to
    them by xref elements with format='counter'.  Fixes issue #241.

  * Added wrapping and indentation of long Obsoletes: and Updates: list in the
    text formats.  Fixes issue #232.

  * Tweaked the top_rfc test to require proper line wrapping for long
    Obsoletes: lines; see issue #232.

  * We're now using a blank string for source when rendering a cref element
    with no source given, rather failing to concatenate None to a string.
    Fixes issue #225.

  * Rewrote the xml expansion code to use the same serialization mechanism
    under python 2.x and 3.x, and removed external references by replacing
    the doctype declaration during lxml serialization.

  * Fixed some code that didn't work correctly under python 3.3, by making
    sure to insert unicode strings instead of byte strings into unicode
    templates.

  * Fixed a bug where text was compared with an integer when handling the
    needLines PI.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars>:

  * Fixed ticket #186 based on diffs provided by Leif Johansson <leifj@mnt.se>:
    If the first parse of the XML tree generates a syntax error, then we now 
    produce a warning of that fact.  This is in part to help me track down what 
    is happening at odd intervolts on my system where it generates an error and 
    then has entity resolution problems.

  * Fixed the case of one reference section occurring with an eref.  In this
    case we need to emit the extra header in both locations.  Fixes ticket
    #222.

  * Fixed a bug where text following a cref is missing.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  18 May 2014 16:18:22 +0200


xml2rfc (2.4.5) ietf; urgency=medium

  Another bugfix release, with a majority of the contributions from Jim Schaad.

  * If there is not an RFC number then XXXX is used for the RFC number for to
    internal:/rfc.number - matches v1 behavior.  Fixes issue #114.

  * We now do a better (but not perfect) job of mking sure that section
    headings are not orphaned.  If you have two section headings in a row then
    the first may still be orphaned.  Fixes issue #166.

  * All known page breaking issues have been fixed.  Closes issue #172.

  * Fixed a number of places where the code has to be made to work with both
    Python 2.7 unicode and string whitespace, and Python 3.3. whitespace
    strings, which are always unicode.  Fixes issue #217.

  * Don't count formatting lines (which we can now tell) when computing 
    break hints.

  * Catch any syntax errors raised while we're looking for an RFC number 
    attribute on <rfc/>, so that we'll show all syntax errors found (during the 
    next parse) instead of just one and one.

  * Added tests which generate .txt from .nroff and compares that to the 
    xml2rfc-generated .txt (with some tweaks to handle different number of 
    starting blanklines.  Also corrected the number of initial blank lines 
    output for RFCs in the raw text writer.

  * Not all files on Windows systems have a common root.  This means that one
    cannot always get a relative path between to absolute path file names.
    Catch the error that occurs in these circumstances and just use the
    absolute path name.

  * Nested "format" style lists now include the level in the auto-generated
    counter value.  Fixes issue #218.

  * EREFs are now put into the references section for text based output.
    Fixes issue #133.

  * cref elements are not dealt with when inline is either yes or no for text
    files.  They are also now populated for html files as well.  Fixes issue
    #201.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Jan 2014 17:08:54 +0100

xml2rfc (2.4.4) ietf; urgency=medium

  Another release with major contributions from Jim Schaad.  This release
  primarily addresses page-breaking issues, but also improves the reporting
  of syntax errors (if any) in the xml input.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars.com>:

  * We now do a better (but not perfect) job of mking sure that section
    headings are not orphaned.  If you have two section headings in a row then
    the first may still be orphaned.  Fixes issue #166.

  * Improved autobreaking, in a number of different places.  Fixes issue #172.

  * In all examples in the test suite, the .txt and .nroff output now have the
    same page breaks.

  * Eliminated the line-breaking of 'Section N' in text-tables which was
    introduced in 2.4.4.  Fixes ticket #217.

  * If there is not an RFC number then XXXX is used for the RFC number for to
    internal:/rfc.number - matches v1 behavior.  Fixes issue #114.

  From Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>:

  * Instead of previously only showing one single syntax error per invocation
    of xml2rfc, we're now showing all syntax errors found throughout the xml
    file at once.

  * Added tests which generate .txt from .nroff and compares that to the 
    xml2rfc-generated .txt (with some tweaks to handle different number of 
    starting blanklines.  Also corrected the number of initial blank lines 
    output for RFCs in the raw text writer.

xml2rfc (2.4.4) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release, with code fixes almost entirely from Jim Schaad.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars.com>:

  * Annotations now output more than just the first text field.  It now
    expands all of the child elements as part of the output. Fixes issue #183.

  * If the authors string is zero length, then we do not emit the comma
    separating the authors and the title. Fixes issue #137.

  * Each street line is now tagged as class vcardline so it is emitted on a
    separate line. Fixes issue #153.

  * Fixed a problem with unreferenced references warnings being emitted twice
    if there were two references sections.

  * Fixed some list indentation problems.  We now default to an indent of 3
    for hanging lists which is the same thing that v1 did.  We also use a
    value based on the bullet for format lists rather than using the 3 of a
    default hang indent - this also now matches v1 behavior.

  * Use width of bullet not default to 3*level+3

  * Fixed issue #147 - a hangingText without any text in the body now emits
    the hangingText. Fixes issue #117.

  * Set of fixes that deal with xref in documents.

  * Set of fixes that deal with references.

  * We now use the anchor rather than the generated bullet as the id of the
    reference element. Fixes issue #209.

  * The html did not have the same check for symrefs when sorting references
    that the text version did.  Copy it over so they both only sort if symrefs
    is yes. Fixes issue #210 and #170.

  * Anchors on t elements in a section were referencable, but no
    those in lists.  They are now referencable. Fixes issue #149.

  * We now generate a warning when we get a target in an xref that we have not
    created an indexable reference for.  This basically gives us an internal
    error check.

  * We now generate a warning when a reference is created that is not targeted
    by an xref in the document.

  * Fixed the centering algorithm so that the nroff and txt output files are
    more consistent.

  * Left shift artwork that is greater than 69 characters wide and steal space
    from the left margin. Fixes issue #129.

  *  & 194 which deal with how figures are layout

  * Fixed issue #132 - if the artwork has an alignment - then it overrides the
    figure's version for the purpose of the artwork itself. Fixes issue #151.

  * Suppres-title kills the title decoration (i.e. Figure 1:) which matches v1
    behavior. Fixes issue #213.

  * Convert all non-ASCII characters to entities when building the HTML body.
    We now are correct when we advertise it as being a us-ascii file.

  * Mixed two fixes back to the real source tree.

  * Rewrite of the basic low level code to use unicode strings in many places
    rather than convert the unicode characters into xml entity codes and try
    to use them.  Doing so cleans up much of the line wrapping problems.

  * URLs, when tagged to be not wrapped, now use different Unicode markers on
    the slashes and hyphens so that they will preferentially break on slashes
    rather than hyphens when a URL is too long to fit into a single line of
    text.

  * Tracker issues addressed: #192, #167, #168, #193, #200, #122, #139

  * Increase the amount of text in the INSTALL document to deal with more
    information on how to install for windows. Fixes issue #184.

  * Don't emit the references section and TOC entry if there are no references
    to be emitted. Fixes issue #205.

  * Centering code did not take into account the .in X nroff command.  Always
    use .in 0 for emission of raw text. Fixes issue #203.

  * The TCL code for deciding on table column widths has been moved into the
    new code. Fixes issue #173.

  * We now look for and do expansions for header cells just like normal
    cells. Fixes issue #131.

  * We now remove all entity references when doing an xml output

  * Fixed issue #146 - The code now allows for the assumption that the file
    name given is what it really is and then tries with the .xml appended if
    it is not found. Fixes issue #154.

  * Lots of errors added to tell about bad table layouts

  * allow make to run without pyflakes. Fixes issue #199.

  From Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>:

  * Modified the code that saves page-break hints when building the
    unpaginated text so that it doesn't overwrite existing hints used for
    artwork and tables (which should not be broken across pages if at all
    possible) with hints that indicate regular text paragraphs (which may be
    broken except if that creates a widow or orphan).  Fixes issue #179 by
    making the code do for artwork and tables what needLines used to do,
    without needing the manual needLines hint.

xml2rfc (2.4.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release adds compatibility with Python 3.3; the test suite has been
  run for Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 using the 'tox' tool.

  This release also includes a large number of bugfixes, from people working
  at improving xml2rfc during the IETF-88 code sprint.

  Details:

  From Tony Hansen <tony@att.com>:

  * Eliminated spurious dots before author names on page 1.  Fixes issue #189.

  * Fixed the style of nested letter-style lists.  Fixes issue #127

  * Added a handling for empty <?rfc?> PIs within references.  Fixes issue #181.

  * Removed trailing whitespace from reference title, organization.  Fixes
    issue #171.

  * Added support v1 list formats %o, %x, and %X.  Fixes issue #204.

  * Fixed a bad html selector which had a trailing '3'.  Fixes issue #197.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars>:

  * Removed leading zeros on dates.  Fixes issue #206.

  * Fixed a crash when a new page had just been created, and it was totally
    empty.  It is unknown if this can occur someplace other than for the last
    page, but it should have check in other locations to look for that.  In
    addition we needed a change to figure out that we had already emitted a
    header for the page we are not going to use any longer and delete it.  Fixes
    issue #187.

  * Handled the missing \& to escape a period at the beginning of a line.  If we
    do a raw emission (i.e. inside of a figure) then we need to go back over the
    lines we just put into the buffer and check to see if any of them have
    leading periods and quote them.  Fixes issue #191.

  * Removed extraneous .ce 0 and blank lines in the nroff.  Since it was using
    the paging formatter in the process of building the nroff output, it kept
    all of the blank lines at the end of each page and emitted them.  There is
    no check in the nroff page_break function which removes any empty lines at
    the end of the array prior to emitting the ".bp" directive (or not emitting
    it if it is the last thing in the file.  Fixes issue #180.

  * Now correctly picks up the day if a day is provided and uses the current day
    for a draft if the month and year are current.  We now allow for both the
    full name of the month and the abbreviated name of the month to be used,
    however there may be some interesting questions to look at if November is
    not in the current locale.  Fixes issue #195.

  * Fixed the text-list-symbols PI to work at all levels.  The list should
    inherit style from the nearest parent that has one.  Fixes issue #126.

  From Elwyn Davies <elwynd@dial.pipex.com>: 

  * Don't emit '\%' before 'Section' for xrefs in the nroff writer.  Fixes
    issue #169.

  From Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>:

  * Modified the iref index output to use consistent sorting for items
    and subitems.

  * Removed the restriction to python 2.x from setup.py

  * Ported xml2rfc to python 3.3 while maintaining compatibility with 2.6 
    and 2.7.

  * Added support for tox testing covering python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3

xml2rfc (2.4.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release fixes all major and critical issues registered in the issue
  tracker as of 26 May 2013.  Details:

  * Applied a patch from ht@inf.ed.ac.uk to sort references (when PI
    sortrefs==yes), and added code to insert a link target if the reference
    has a 'target' attribute. Fixes issue #175.

  * Added pre-installation requirements to the INSTALL file.  Added code to
    scripts/xml2rfc in order to avoid problems if that file is renamed to
    scripts/xml2rfc.py.  This fixes issue #152.

  * Added a setup requirement for python <3.0, as things don't currently
    work if trying to run setup.py or xml2rfc with python 3.X.

  * Added special cases to avoid adding double spaces after many common
    abbreviations.  Refined the sentence-end double-space fixup further, to
    look at whether what follows looks like the start of a new sentence.
    This fixes issue #115.  

  * Moved the get_initials() function to the BaseRfcWriter, as it now needs
    to look at a PI.  Added code to return one initial only, or multiple,
    depending on the PI 'multiple-initials' setting.  Fixes issue #138 (for
    now).  It is possible that this resolution is too simpleminded, and a
    cleaner way is needed to differentiate the handling of initials in the
    current document versus initials in references.

  * Added new undocumented PI multiple-initials to control whether multiple
    initials will be shown for an author, or not.  The default is 'no',
    matching the xml2rfc v1.x behaviour.

  * Fixed the code which determines when an author affiliation doesn't need
    to be listed again in the front page author list, and removes the
    redundant affiliation (the old code would remove the *first* matching
    organization, rather than the immediately preceeding organization name).
    Also fixed a buggy test of when an organization element is present.
    Fixes issue #135.

  * Made appearance of 'Authors Address' (etc.) in ToC dependent on PI
    'rfcedstyle' == 'yes'.  Fixes issue #125.

  * Updated write_text() to handle long bullets that need to be wrapped
    across lines better.  Fixes issue #124.

  * Fixed two other cases of missing blank lines when PI 'compact' is 'no'.
    Fixes issue #82 (some more).

  * Disabled the iprnotified IP.  See issue #123; closes #123.

  * When protecting http: URLs from line-breaking in nroff output, place the
    \% outside enclosing parentheses, if any.  Fixes issue #120.

  * Added a warning for incomplete and out-of-date <date/> elements.  Fixed
    an issue with changeset [792].

  * Issue a warning when the source file isn't for an RFC, but doesn't have
    a docName attribute in the <rfc/> element.

  * Fixed the use of separating lines in table drawing, to match v1 for text
    and nroff output.  (There is no specification for the meaining of the
    different styles though...).  Fixes issue #113.  Note that additional
    style definitions are needed to get the correct results for the html
    output.

  * Refactored and re-wrote the paginated text writer and the nroff writer
    in order to generate a ToC in nroff by re-using the fairly complex
    post-rendering code which inserts the ToC (and iref entries) in the
    paginated text writer.  As a side effect, the page-breaking calculations
    for the nroff writer becomes the same as for the paginated writer.
    Re-factored the line and page-break emitting code to be cleaner and more
    readable.  Changed the code to not start inserting a ToC too close to
    the end of a page (currently hardcoded to require at least 10 lines),
    otherwise skip to a new page.  Fixes issue #109.

  * Changed the author list in first-page header to show a blank line if no
    organization has been given.  Fixes issue #108.

  * Changed the wrapping of nroff output to match text output closely, in
    order to minimize insertion of .bp in the middle of a line.  Fixes issue
    #150 (mostly -- line breaks on hyphens may still cause .bp to be emitted
    in the middle of a line in very rare cases).

  * Changed nroff output for long titles (which will wrap) so that the
    wrapped title text will be indented appropriately.  Fixes issue #128.

  * Changed the handling of special characters (nbsp, nbhy) so as to emit
    the proper non-breaking escapes for nroff.  Fixes issue #121.

  * Changed start-of-line nroff escape handling, see issue #118.

  * Changed the generation of xref text to use the same numeric indexes as
    in the references section when symrefs='no'.  Don't start numbering over
    again when starting a new references section (i.e., when moving from
    normative to informative).  Don't re-sort numeric references
    alphabetically; they are already sorted numerically.  Fixes issue #107.

  * Changed os.linesep to '<NL>' when writing lines to text files.  The
    library takes care of doing the right thing on different platforms;
    writing os.linesep on the other hand will result in the file containing
    '<CR><CR><NL>', which is wrong.  Fixes issue #141.

  * Changed handling of include PIs to replace the PI instead of just
    appending the included tree.  Updated a test file to match updated test
    case.  Fixes issue #136.

xml2rfc (2.4.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a problem with very long hangindent bullet text followed by

    make xml2rfc abort with a traceback for certain inputs.

  https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/report/

  An extract from the commit log is available below:

  * In some cases, the error messages when validating an xml document are 
    correct, but too obscure.  If a required element is absent, the error 
    message could say for instance 'Element references content does not follow 
    the DTD, expecting (reference)+, got ', which is correct -- the DTD 
    validator  got nothing, when it required something, so it says 'got ', with 
    nothing after 'got'.  But for a regular user, we now add on 'nothing.' to 
    make things clearer.  Fixes issue #102.

  * It seems there could be a bug in separate invocation of 
    lxml.etree.DTD.validate(tree) after parsing, compared to doing parsing with 
    dtd_validation=True.  The former fails in a case when it shouldn't, while 
    the latter succeeds in validating a valid document.  Declaring validation 
    as successful if the dtd.error_log is empty, even if validation returned 
    False.  This resolves issue #103.

  * Factored out the code which gets an author's initials from the xml 
    author element, and made the get_initials() utility function return 
    initials fixed up with trailing spaces, if missing.  The current code does 
    not mangle initials by removing any initials but the first one.  Fixes 
    issue #63, closes issue #10.


  * Added code to avoid breaking URLs in boilerplate across lines.  Fixes 
    issue #78.
  * Added PI defaults for 'figurecount' and 'tablecount' (not listed in the 
    xml2rfc readme...)  Also removed coupling between explicitly set 
    rfcedstyle, compact, and subcompact settings, to follow v1 practice.

  * Refactored the PI defaults to appear all in the same place, rather than 
    spread out throughout the code.


  * Updated draw_table to insert blank rows when PI compact is 'no'. Fixes 
    issue #82.

  * Added tests and special handling for the case when a hanging type list 
    has less space left on the first line, after the bullet, than what's needed 
    for the first following word.  In that case, start the list text on the 
    following line.  Fixes issue #85.

  * Modified the page-breaking code to better keep section titles together 
    with the section text, and keep figure preamble, figure, postamble and 
    caption together.  Updated tests.  Fixes issue #100.

  * Added handling of tocdepth to the html writer.  Fixes issue #101.

  * Modified how the --base switch to the xml2rfc script works, to make it 
    easier to generate multiple output formats and place them all in the same 
    target directory.  Also changed the default extensions for two output 
    formats (.raw.txt and .exp.xml).

  * Tweaked the html template to not permit crazy wide pages.

  * Rewrote parts of the parsing in order to get hold of the number 
    attribute of the <rfc/> tag before the full parsing is done, in order to be 
    able to later resolve the &rfc.number; entity (which, based on how 
    convoluted it is to get that right, I'd like to deprecate.)  Fixes issue 
    #86.

  * Numerous small fixes to indentation and wrapping of references.  Avoid 
    wrapping URLs in references if possible.  Avoid wrapping 'Section 3.14.' if 
    possible.  Indent more like xml2rfc v1.

  * Added reduction of doublespaces in regular text, except when they might 
    be at the end of a sentence.  Xml2rfc v1 would do this, v2 didn't till now.

  * Generalized the _format_counter() method to consistently handle list 
    counter field-widths internally, and made it adjust the field-width to the 
    max counter width based on the list length and counter type.  Fixes an v1 
    to -v2 incompatibility for numbered lists with 10 items or more, and other 
    similar cases.

  * Added generic base conversion code, and used that to generate list 
    letters which will work for lists with more than 26 items.

  * Reworked code to render roman numerals in lists, to place whitespace 
    correctly in justification field.  Fixes issue #94.

  * Added consensus vs. no-consensus options for IAB RFCs' Status of This 
    Memo section.  Fixes issue #88.

  * Made <t/> elements with an anchor attribute generate html with an <a 
    name='...'/> elemnt, for linking.  Closes issue #67.

  * Applied boilerplate URL-splitting prevention only in the raw writer 
    where later do paragraph line-wrapping, instead of generically.  Fixes 
    issue #62.

  * Now permitting all versions of lxml >= 2.2.8, but notice that there may 
    be missing build dependencies for lxml 3.x which may cause installation of 
    lxml to fail.  (That's an lxml issue, rather than an xml2rfc issue, 
    though...)  This fixes issue #99.

xml2rfc (2.3.11.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Tweaked the install_required setting in setup.py to not pull down lxml 3.x
    (as it's not been tested with xml2rfc) and bumped the version.

xml2rfc (2.3.11) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release fixes all outstanding major bugs, details below.
  The issue tracker is at https://tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/.

  * Updated the nroff writer to do backslash escaping on source text, to 
    avoid escaping nroff control characters.  Fixes issue #77.

  * Added a modified xref writer to the nroff output writer, in order to 
    handle xref targets which should not be broken across lines.  This, 
    together with changeset [688], fixes issue #80.

  * Added text to the section test case to trigger the second part of issue 
    #79.  It turns out that the changes in [688] fixed this, too; this closes 
    issue #79.

  * Tweaked the nroff generation to not break on hyphens, in order to avoid 
    hyphenated words ending up with embedded spaces: 'pre-processing' becoming 
    'pre- processing' if 'pre-' occurred at the end of an nroff text line.  
    Also tweaked the line-width used in line-breaking to have matching 
    line-breaks between .txt and .nroff output (with exception for lines ending 
    in hyphens).

  * Tweaked roman number list counter to output roman numbers in a field 5 
    spaces wide, instead of having varied widths.  This is different from 
    version 1, so may have to be reverted, depending on how people react.

  * Added a warning for too long lines in figures and tables.  No 
    outdenting for now; I'd like to consult some about that. Fixes issue #76.

  * Updated tests showing that all list format specifiers mentioned in 
    issue #70 now works.  Closes isssue #70.

  * Changed spanx emphasis back to _this_ instead of -this-, matching the v1 
    behaviour.  Addresses issue #70.

  * Make <vspace/> in a hangindent list reset the indentation to the 
    hang-indent, even if the bullet text is longer than the hang-indent.  
    Addresses issue #70.

  * Refined the page-breaking to not insert an extra page break for artwork
    that won't fit on a page anyway.

  * Refined the page-breaking to avoid breaking artwork and tables across 
    pages, if possible.

  * Fixed a problem with centering of titles and labels.  Fixes issue #73.

  * Changed the leading and trailing whitespace lines of a page to better 
    match legacy output.  Fixed the autobreaking algorithm to correctly avoid 
    orphans and widows; fixes issue #72.  Removed an extra blank line at the 
    top of the page following an early page break to avoid orphan or widow.

  * Tweaked the generation of ToC dot-lines and page numbers to better 
    match legacy xml2rfc.  Fixed a bug in the generation of xref text where 
    trailing whitespace could cause double spaces.  Tweaked the output format 
    to produce the correct number of leading blank lines on the first page of a 
    document.

  * Modified the handling of figure titles, so that given titles will be 
    written also without anchor or figure counting.  Fixes issue #75.

  * Tweaked the html writer to have a buffer interface that provides a 
    self.buf similar to the other writers, for test purposes.

  * Reworked the WriterElementTest suite to test all the output formats, 
    not only paginated text.

  * Added a note about /usr/local/bin permissions.  This closes issue #65.

  * Added files describing possible install methods (INSTALL), and possible 
    build commands (Makefile).

  * The syntax that was used to specify the version of the lxml dependency 
    ('>=') is not supported in python distutil setup.py files, and caused setup 
    to try to find an lxml version greater than =2.2.8, which couldn't succeed. 
    Fixed to say '>2.2.7' instead.  This was probably the cause of always 
    reinstalling lxml even when it was present.

  * Updated README.rst to cover the new --date option, and tweaked it a bit.

  * Added some files to provide an enhanced source distribution package.

  * Updated setup.py with maintainer and licence information.

xml2rfc (2.3.10) ietf; urgency=low

  * Changed the output text for Internet-Draft references to omit the 
    series name, but add (work in progress).  Updated the test case to match 
    draft revision number.

  * Updated all the rfc editor boilerplate in valid test facits to match the 
    correct outcome (which is also what the code actually produces).

  * Changed the diff test error message so that the valid text is output as 
    the original, not as the changed text of a diff.

  * Corrected test cases to match correct expiry using 185 days instead of 
    183 days from document date.

  * Added missing attributes to the XmlRfcError Exception subclass, 
    necessary in order to make it resemble lxml's error class and provide 
    consistent error messages to the user whether they come from lxml or our 
    own code.

  * Added a licence file, indicating the licencing used by the IETF for the 
    xml2rfc code.

  * Fixed up the xml2rfc cli script to provide better help texts by telling 
    the option parser the appropriate option variable names.

  * Fixed up the help text formatting by explicitly providing an appropriate
    help text formatter to the option parser.  

  * Added an option (--date=DATE)to provide the document date on the command
    line.

  * Added an option (--no-dtd) to disable the DTD validation step.  

  * Added code to catch additional exceptions and provide appropriate user
    information, instead of an exception traceback.
