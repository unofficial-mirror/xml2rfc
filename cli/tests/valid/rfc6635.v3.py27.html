        The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is
        concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series,
        orderly RFC Editor succession, RFC quality, and
        RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the
        concerns of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
        about providing the necessary services in a cost-effective and
        efficient manner.

   The contemporary RFC Editor model <span>[<a href="#RFC5620" class="xref">RFC5620</a>] was
first approved in October 2008, and our understanding of the model
has evolved with our experience since. During the implementation
of version 1 of the model </span><span>[<a href="#RFC5620" class="xref">RFC5620</a>], it was quickly
realized that the role of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) and the  
   oversight responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In
   order to gain experience with "running code", a transitional RSE
   was hired who analyzed the managerial environment and provided
   recommendations. This was followed by the appointment of an acting
RSE, who ably managed the series while work was
undertaken to select and hire a permanent RSE.
This version of the model is based on the recommendations
of both temporary RFC Series Editors
   and the extensive discussion in the IETF community, on
the rfc-interest list, and within the IAB. As such, this document
obsoletes </span><span>[<a href="#RFC5620" class="xref">RFC5620</a>].

   This document, and the resulting structures,
   will be modified as needed through normal procedures.  The RSE, and
the IAB, through the RFC Oversight Committee (see <a href="#RSOC" class="xref">Section 3.1</a>), will
continue to monitor discussions  
   within the community about potential
   adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognize that the process
   described in this document may need to be adjusted to align with any
   changes that result from such discussions; hence, the version number
   in the title.

     Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
     Series (the RFC Editor). The task has grown, and the work now
     requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are
     RFC Editors, or an RFC Editor organization. In time, there may be
     multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
     required by the RFC Series. For simplicity's sake, and without
     attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
     this document refers to this collection of experts and 
     organizations as the "RFC Editor".<a href="#section-1.1-2.1" class="pilcrow">¶</a>
</li>
<li class="ulEmpty" id="section-1.1-2.2">     The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
     acting to support the mission of the RFC Series. As such, the RFC
     Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
     RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes. In addition,
     the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
     discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
     RFCs.<a href="#section-1.1-2.2" class="pilcrow">¶</a>

        RFC 4844 does not explore the internal organization
        of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the
        RFC Editor organizational structure. There have been several
iterations on efforts to improve and clarify this structure.  These
have been led by the IAB, in consultation with the community and many
leadership bodies within the community.  This first resulted in the
publication of <span>[<a href="#RFC5620" class="xref">RFC5620</a>] and then in further
discussions leading to this document.  Some of the details on
this evolution can be found below.  In undertaking this evolution,
the IAB considered changes that increase
        flexibility and operational support options, provide for the
        orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the
        continuity of the RFC Series, while maintaining RFC quality,
        maintaining timely processing, ensuring document
        accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost
        transparency. The model set forth below describes the internal
organization of 
        the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.

        this memo provides a model for internal organization. This
        memo defines the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series

<p id="section-2-5">
        In this model, documents are produced and approved through
        multiple document streams.  The stream manager for each stream
        is responsible for the content of that stream.  
        The four streams that now exist are described in <span>[<a href="#RFC4844" class="xref">RFC4844</a>]. 
        The RFC Editor function is responsible for the packaging and
        distribution of the documents.  As such,  documents from these
        streams are 
        edited and processed by the Production Center and published by
        the Publisher.  The RFC Series Editor will exercise
        strategic leadership and  management over the activities of the
        RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (both of which can
        be seen as back-office functions) and will be the entity that:

<p id="section-2.1.1-1"> With respect to the RFC Publisher and Production Center functions, the RSE
      provides input to the IASA budget, SOWs, and manages
      vendor selection processes.  The RSE performs annual reviews of
      the RFC Production Center and Publisher function, which are then provided to
      the RSOC, the IASA, and the community.  Normally, private
      financial details would not be included in a public version
      unless the IAOC concludes it is necessary to make such
      information public.

<p id="section-2.1.2.1-1">The RSE is the primary point of contact to the IETF on

are generally worked through directly with the RFC Production Center
staff.<a href="#section-2.1.2.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-2.1.2.1-3">Due to the history and nature of the interaction between
the RSE and the IETF, certain principles, described in the following
subsections,  must be understood and

<p id="section-2.1.2.1.1-1">The vast majority of Internet technical community work
is led, initiated, and done by community volunteers, including
oversight, policy making, and direct production of, for example, many
software tools.  The RSE, while not a volunteer, is dependent 
upon these volunteer participants.  Also, the spirit of the community 
is heavily focused on and draws from these volunteers.  As such, the
RSE needs to support the vitality and effectiveness of
volunteer participation.<a href="#section-2.1.2.1.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-2.1.2.1.2-1">All decisions are to be made in the overall interest of the
broader Internet community.  The RSE is responsible for identifying
materially concerned interest groups within the Internet community and
reaching out to them.  Those interest groups include at least the IETF
community, the IRTF community, the network research community, and the
network operations community.  Other interest groups might also be
materially interested.<a href="#section-2.1.2.1.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.1.2.1.2-2">The RSE must consult with the community on policy issues.  The
RSE works with the community to achieve policy that meets the overall
quality, continuity, and evolution goals the RSE is charged with
meeting.  As described in  <a href="#RSOC" class="xref">Section 3.1</a>, the RSE reports the
results of such interactions to the RSOC, including a description of
the outreach efforts and the specific recommendations on policy.  This
enables the RSOC to provide the oversight the IAB is required to
apply, as well as to confirm that the Internet community has been
properly consulted and considered in making policy.<a href="#section-2.1.2.1.2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

    it will be the RSOC that will approve consensus policy and vision
    documents as developed by the RSE in collaboration with the
    community.  While it is expected that the IAB will exercise due
    diligence in its supervision of the RSOC,  the RSOC should be
    allowed the latitude to do its job without undue interference
    from the IAB.  Therefore, it is expected that the IAB
    will accord RSOC reports and recommendations the benefit of
    the doubt.<a href="#section-3.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1-4">For all decisions that affect the RSE individually (e.g., hiring and firing),

   <a href="#section-3.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<li id="section-3.1-5.1">perform annual reviews of the RSE and report the result of

<li id="section-3.1-5.2"> manage RSE candidate selection and advise the IAB on candidate

will propose a budget for the search process. It will work with
IASA to refine that budget and develop remuneration
criteria and an employment agreement or contracting plans,
as appropriate.

<p id="section-3.1-10">The initial RSOC was charged with designing and executing a
solicitation, search, and selection process for the first
actual (not transitional or "acting") RSE appointment. That
process involved iteration on this and
related documents and evaluation of various strategies and
options.   During the creation of this document, it was expected that the RSOC
would describe the process it ultimately selected to the community.
The RSOC did involve the
community in interim considerations when that was likely to
be of value. Following completion of the selection process,
the RSOC will determine the best way to share information
learned and experience gained with the community and 
determine how to best preserve that information for future
use.

</h4>
<p id="section-3.1.1-1">
   The RSOC will operate under the authority of the IAB, with the IAB 
   retaining final responsibility.  The IAB will delegate authority and
   responsibility to the RSOC as appropriate and as RSOC and RSE
   relationships evolve.  The RSOC will include people who are not
   current IAB members.  Currently, this is aligned with the IAB
   program structure.   The IAB will designate the
   membership of the RSOC with the following goals: preserving effective
   stability; keeping it small enough to be effective, and keeping it large enough
   to provide general Internet community expertise, specific IETF
   expertise, publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members
   serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance
   between short- and long-term perspectives.  Specific input about, and
   recommendations of, members will be sought from the streams, the
   IASA, and the RSE.<a href="#section-3.1.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1.1-2">In addition to the members from outside of the IAB appointed to
the RSOC, IAB members may participate as full members of the RSOC.
Under most circumstances, there will be a specific individual IAB
member appointed by the IAB as the program lead, who will be a full
member of the RSOC.  This member's role is distinct from any RSOC-internal organizational roles, such as would be created by the RSOC choosing to appoint a
chair from among its members.  Other IAB members may choose to be full
members of the RSOC, with the consent of the IAB.  This consent is
primarily concerned with avoiding overpopulating the RSOC and
providing it with relatively stable membership, which will
work best if it is not too large a committee.<a href="#section-3.1.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.1.1-3">The IAOC will appoint an individual to serve as its liaison to
   the RSOC.  The RSE and the IAOC Liaison will serve as
   non-voting ex officio members of the RSOC.  Either or both can be
   excluded from its discussions if necessary.<a href="#section-3.1.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

RSOC or the IAOC could find themselves in disagreement with some 
aspect of the RFC Editor operations.  Note that disagreements between
an author and the RFC Production Center are not cross-entity issues, and

party may ask the RSE to decide or, especially if the RSE is involved, 
the party may ask the IAB Chair (for a technical or procedural matter) 
to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in the discussions, although 
he or she not is obligated to do so. All parties should work 
informally and in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable
conclusion.  As noted below, any such issues that involve contractual
matters must be brought to the attention of the IAOC.  If the IAB Chair
is asked to assist in resolving the matter, the Chair may ask for
advice or seek assistance from anyone the Chair deems helpful.  The
Chair may also alert any appropriate individuals or organizations to
the existence of the issue.

          If such a conclusion is not possible through the above less formal
          processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC
          Series Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice
          to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved
          and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates
          its advice. However, if a timely decision cannot be reached
          through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the
          RSE is expected to make whatever decisions are
          needed to ensure the smooth operation of the RFC Editor
          function; those decisions are final.
        <a href="#section-4.3-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.3-4">
          The RSE may make final decisions unilaterally only to assure
          the functioning of the process, and only while there is an
          evaluation of current policies to determine whether they are
          appropriately implemented in the decision or need
          adjustment. In particular, it should be noted that final
decisions about the technical content of individual
documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream
approvers from which those documents originate, as shown in the illustration
in <a href="#model-figure" class="xref">Figure 1</a>.

<p id="section-4.3-5">
          If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC
          review and decision making may be required.  If so, the
          RSE must present the issues involved to the community
          so that the community is aware of the situation.  The RSE
          will then report the issue to the RSOC for formal resolution
          by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB in its oversight
          capacity.

      introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor 
      maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be
      in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
      by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source
      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
      and, for some early items, originals that are not
      machine readable) need to be secured against any kind of data
      storage failure.

      The RFC Editor model was conceived and discussed in hallways and
      on mailing lists. The first iteration of the text on which this
      document is based was first written by Leslie Daigle, Russ
      Housley, and Ray Pelletier. In addition to the members of the
      IAOC and IAB in conjunction with those roles, major and minor
