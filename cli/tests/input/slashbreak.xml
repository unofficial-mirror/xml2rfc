<section title="Slash Break Tests">
   <t>
      The RFC Editor has asked that we provide a list of items
      for which there will never be a break around the slash.
      The test says that PDF/A and S/MIME should not be broken
      when they occur.
   </t>
   <t>
      We also deal with the possiblity of some long items such as
      this/is/a/long/test which will not break either.  We only match
      exact items however so PDF/A/3 will be broken as the algorithm
      currently stands.
   </t>
   <t>
      What about addresses: 192.168.20.0/16, 192.168.0.0/24,
      192.168.0.0/30, and prefix length indications like /48 /56 /64 /72
      /80 /88 /96 and so on?  These should not be broken after the forward
      slash.
