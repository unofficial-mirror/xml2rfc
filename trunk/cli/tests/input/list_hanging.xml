<t>Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
the hangIndent: 
  <list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Item A:">Here is an example of a setence that
    follows the "hangText" in a list item in a hanging list.</t>

    <t hangText="Item B with a much longer label:">Here is an
    example if the text
    following the "hangText" is long and
    wraps, the indent (set to 8 in the XML) is used.
    </t>

    <t hangText="Item C:"><vspace blankLines="0"/> Here's an
    example where a
    vspace element has been inserted so the text starts on a new
    line (instead of next to the "hangText".<vspace blankLines="1"/>
    And something which should look like a new paragraph for the same
    hangindent item.</t>

    <t hangText="Item D with a very longer label followed by &lt;vspace/&gt;:"><vspace/>Here is an
    example if the text
    following the "hangText" is long and
    wraps, the indent (set to 8 in the XML) is used.
    </t>

  </list>
