Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current
Internet-Drafts is at \%http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any

1.  Introduction

The original specification of xml2rfc format is in RFC 2629
[RFC2629].

.ti 0
1.1.  Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

.ti 0
2.  Simple List

List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
\'format'.

3.  Figures

Figures should not exceed 69 characters wide to allow for the indent
of sections.

.ce 1
Preamble text - can be omitted or empty.

Cross-references allowed in pre- and postamble.  [min_ref].

Figure 1

The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
< (&lt;) and & (&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also have
a title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also an
anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant in
figures even if you don't use CDATA.

4.  Subsections and Tables

.ti 0
4.1.  A Subsection

By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

.ti 0
4.2.  Tables

.. are very similar to figures:

.ce 2
Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
then has a "c" element for its content.

                        +----------+----------+
                        | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                        +----------+----------+
                        |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                        |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                        |   c #5   |   c #6   |

5.  More about Lists
.bp

Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
the hangIndent:

.in 11
.ti 3
short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

.ti 3
fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

Forces the new item to start on a new line.

Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

.in 7
.ti 3
a.  First, a short item.

.ti 3
b.  Second, a longer list item.
.sp 1

And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

.in 3
Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

another hunter in the great wood in the west.

.ti 0
5.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

.in 3
Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
"counter" variable.

First list:

.in 7
.ti 3
R1  #1

.ti 3
R2  #2

.ti 3
R3  #3
.bp

.in 3
Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

Second list:

.in 7
.ti 3
R4  #4

.ti 3
R5  #5

.ti 3
R6  #6

.ti 0
5.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

.in 3
List continues here.

Third list:

.in 7
.ti 3
R7  #7

.ti 3
R8  #8

.ti 3
R9  #9

.ti 3
R10 #10

.in 3
The end of the list.

6.  Example of Code or MIB Module To Be Extracted

The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details).  It also has a
"type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
\'type="abnf"'.  In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
versions of xml2rfc.

7.  Acknowledgements

This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka

8.  IANA Considerations

This memo includes no request to IANA.

All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
the update of RFC 2434 \%[I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

.ti 0
9.  Security Considerations

All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
