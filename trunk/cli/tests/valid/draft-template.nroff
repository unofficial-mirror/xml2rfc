1.  Introduction

The original specification of xml2rfc format is in RFC\02629
[RFC2629].

.ti 0
1.1.  Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

.ti 0
2.  Simple List

List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
\'format'.

.in 6
.ti 3
o  First bullet

.ti 3
o  Second bullet

.in 3
You can write text here as well.

.ti 0
3.  Figures

Figures should not exceed 69 characters wide to allow for the indent
.bp
of sections.

.ce 1
Preamble text - can be omitted or empty.
.nf

                       +-----------------------+
                       | Use XML, be Happy :-) |
                       |_______________________|
.fi

.ce 1
Cross-references allowed in pre- and postamble. [min_ref].

.ce 1
Figure 1

The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
<\0(&lt;) and &\0(&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also
have a title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also
an anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant
in figures even if you don't use CDATA.

4.  Subsections and Tables

.ti 0
4.1.  A Subsection

By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

.ti 0
4.2.  Tables

\&.. are very similar to figures:

.ce 2
Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
then has a "c" element for its content.
.nf

                        +----------+----------+
                        | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                        +----------+----------+
                        |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                        |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                        |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                        +----------+----------+

5.  More about Lists

Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
the hangIndent:
.bp
.in 11
.ti 3
short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

.ti 3
fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

Forces the new item to start on a new line.

Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

.in 7
.ti 3
a.  First, a short item.

.ti 3
b.  Second, a longer list item.
.sp 1
And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

.in 3
Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

.in 6
The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to fool
many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

.ti 0
5.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

.in 3
Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
"counter" variable.

First list:

.in 7
.ti 3
R1  #1

.ti 3
R2  #2

.ti 3
R3  #3

.in 3
Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

Second list:

.in 7
.ti 3
R4  #4

.ti 3
R5  #5

.ti 3
R6  #6

.ti 0
5.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

.in 3
List continues here.
.bp
Third list:

.in 7
.ti 3
R7  #7

.ti 3
R8  #8

.ti 3
R9  #9

.ti 3
R10 #10

.in 3
The end of the list.

.ti 0
5.3.  nested lists

Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

.in 7
.ti 3
a.  First, a short item.

.ti 3
b.  Second, a longer list item.
.sp 1
And something that looks like a separate paragraph.

.ti 3
c.  and a sublist, also with letters

.in 11
.ti 7
a.  first subitem

.ti 7
b.  second subitem

.ti 7
c.  and a sub-sublist, also with letters

.in 15
.ti 11
a.  first sub-subitem

.ti 11
b.  second sub-subitem

6.  Example of Code or MIB Module To Be Extracted

.in 3
The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details).  It also has a
"type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
\'type="abnf"'.  In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
versions of xml2rfc.

7.  Acknowledgements

This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka
Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.

This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable
[DOMINATION].

8.  IANA Considerations

This memo includes no request to IANA.

All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
the update of RFC 2434 \%[I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

.ti 0
9.  Security Considerations

All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
