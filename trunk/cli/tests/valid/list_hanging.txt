   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   Item A: Here is an example of a setence that follows the "hangText"
           in a list item in a hanging list.

   Item B with a much longer label:  Here is an example if the text
           following the "hangText" is long and wraps, the indent (set
           to 8 in the XML) is used.

   Item C: 
           Here's an example where a vspace element has been inserted so
           the text starts on a new line (instead of next to the
           "hangText".

           And something which should look like a new paragraph for the
           same hangindent item.

   Item D with a very longer label followed by <vspace/>:  
           Here is an example if the text following the "hangText" is
           long and wraps, the indent (set to 8 in the XML) is used.
