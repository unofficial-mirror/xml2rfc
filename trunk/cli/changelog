xml2rfc (2.4.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  With this release, all issues against the 2.x series of xml2rfc has been
  resolved.  Without doubt there will be new issues in the issue tracker,
  but the current clean slate is nice to have.

  For full details on all tickets, there's always the issue tracker:
  http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/report/

  An extract from the commit log is available below:

  * In some cases, the error messages when validating an xml document are 
    correct, but too obscure.  If a required element is absent, the error 
    message could say for instance 'Element references content does not follow 
    the DTD, expecting (reference)+, got ', which is correct -- the DTD 
    validator  got nothing, when it required something, so it says 'got ', with 
    nothing after 'got'.  But for a regular user, we now add on 'nothing.' to 
    make things clearer.  Fixes issue #102.

  * It seems there could be a bug in separate invocation of 
    lxml.etree.DTD.validate(tree) after parsing, compared to doing parsing with 
    dtd_validation=True.  The former fails in a case when it shouldn't, while 
    the latter succeeds in validating a valid document.  Declaring validation 
    as successful if the dtd.error_log is empty, even if validation returned 
    False.  This resolves issue #103.

  * Factored out the code which gets an author's initials from the xml 
    author element, and made the get_initials() utility function return 
    initials fixed up with trailing spaces, if missing.  The current code does 
    not mangle initials by removing any initials but the first one.  Fixes 
    issue #63, closes issue #10.


  * Added code to avoid breaking URLs in boilerplate across lines.  Fixes 
    issue #78.
  * Added PI defaults for 'figurecount' and 'tablecount' (not listed in the 
    xml2rfc readme...)  Also removed coupling between explicitly set 
    rfcedstyle, compact, and subcompact settings, to follow v1 practice.

  * Refactored the PI defaults to appear all in the same place, rather than 
    spread out throughout the code.


  * Updated draw_table to insert blank rows when PI compact is 'no'. Fixes 
    issue #82.

  * Added tests and special handling for the case when a hanging type list 
    has less space left on the first line, after the bullet, than what's needed 
    for the first following word.  In that case, start the list text on the 
    following line.  Fixes issue #85.

  * Modified the page-breaking code to better keep section titles together 
    with the section text, and keep figure preamble, figure, postamble and 
    caption together.  Updated tests.  Fixes issue #100.

  * Added handling of tocdepth to the html writer.  Fixes issue #101.

  * Modified how the --base switch to the xml2rfc script works, to make it 
    easier to generate multiple output formats and place them all in the same 
    target directory.  Also changed the default extensions for two output 
    formats (.raw.txt and .exp.xml).

  * Tweaked the html template to not permit crazy wide pages.

  * Rewrote parts of the parsing in order to get hold of the number 
    attribute of the <rfc/> tag before the full parsing is done, in order to be 
    able to later resolve the &rfc.number; entity (which, based on how 
    convoluted it is to get that right, I'd like to deprecate.)  Fixes issue 
    #86.

  * Numerous small fixes to indentation and wrapping of references.  Avoid 
    wrapping URLs in references if possible.  Avoid wrapping 'Section 3.14.' if 
    possible.  Indent more like xml2rfc v1.

  * Added reduction of doublespaces in regular text, except when they might 
    be at the end of a sentence.  Xml2rfc v1 would do this, v2 didn't till now.

  * Generalized the _format_counter() method to consistently handle list 
    counter field-widths internally, and made it adjust the field-width to the 
    max counter width based on the list length and counter type.  Fixes an v1 
    to -v2 incompatibility for numbered lists with 10 items or more, and other 
    similar cases.

  * Added generic base conversion code, and used that to generate list 
    letters which will work for lists with more than 26 items.

  * Reworked code to render roman numerals in lists, to place whitespace 
    correctly in justification field.  Fixes issue #94.

  * Added consensus vs. no-consensus options for IAB RFCs' Status of This 
    Memo section.  Fixes issue #88.

  * Made <t/> elements with an anchor attribute generate html with an <a 
    name='...'/> elemnt, for linking.  Closes issue #67.

  * Applied boilerplate URL-splitting prevention only in the raw writer 
    where later do paragraph line-wrapping, instead of generically.  Fixes 
    issue #62.

  * Now permitting all versions of lxml >= 2.2.8, but notice that there may 
    be missing build dependencies for lxml 3.x which may cause installation of 
    lxml to fail.  (That's an lxml issue, rather than an xml2rfc issue, 
    though...)  This fixes issue #99.

xml2rfc (2.3.11.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Tweaked the install_required setting in setup.py to not pull down lxml 3.x
    (as it's not been tested with xml2rfc) and bumped the version.

xml2rfc (2.3.11) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release fixes all outstanding major bugs, details below.
  The issue tracker is at http://tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/.

  * Updated the nroff writer to do backslash escaping on source text, to 
    avoid escaping nroff control characters.  Fixes issue #77.

  * Added a modified xref writer to the nroff output writer, in order to 
    handle xref targets which should not be broken across lines.  This, 
    together with changeset [688], fixes issue #80.

  * Added text to the section test case to trigger the second part of issue 
    #79.  It turns out that the changes in [688] fixed this, too; this closes 
    issue #79.

  * Tweaked the nroff generation to not break on hyphens, in order to avoid 
    hyphenated words ending up with embedded spaces: 'pre-processing' becoming 
    'pre- processing' if 'pre-' occurred at the end of an nroff text line.  
    Also tweaked the line-width used in line-breaking to have matching 
    line-breaks between .txt and .nroff output (with exception for lines ending 
    in hyphens).

  * Tweaked roman number list counter to output roman numbers in a field 5 
    spaces wide, instead of having varied widths.  This is different from 
    version 1, so may have to be reverted, depending on how people react.

  * Added a warning for too long lines in figures and tables.  No 
    outdenting for now; I'd like to consult some about that. Fixes issue #76.

  * Updated tests showing that all list format specifiers mentioned in 
    issue #70 now works.  Closes isssue #70.

  * Changed spanx emphasis back to _this_ instead of -this-, matching the v1 
    behaviour.  Addresses issue #70.

  * Make <vspace/> in a hangindent list reset the indentation to the 
    hang-indent, even if the bullet text is longer than the hang-indent.  
    Addresses issue #70.

  * Refined the page-breaking to not insert an extra page break for artwork
    that won't fit on a page anyway.

  * Refined the page-breaking to avoid breaking artwork and tables across 
    pages, if possible.

  * Fixed a problem with centering of titles and labels.  Fixes issue #73.

  * Changed the leading and trailing whitespace lines of a page to better 
    match legacy output.  Fixed the autobreaking algorithm to correctly avoid 
    orphans and widows; fixes issue #72.  Removed an extra blank line at the 
    top of the page following an early page break to avoid orphan or widow.

  * Tweaked the generation of ToC dot-lines and page numbers to better 
    match legacy xml2rfc.  Fixed a bug in the generation of xref text where 
    trailing whitespace could cause double spaces.  Tweaked the output format 
    to produce the correct number of leading blank lines on the first page of a 
    document.

  * Modified the handling of figure titles, so that given titles will be 
    written also without anchor or figure counting.  Fixes issue #75.

  * Tweaked the html writer to have a buffer interface that provides a 
    self.buf similar to the other writers, for test purposes.

  * Reworked the WriterElementTest suite to test all the output formats, 
    not only paginated text.

  * Added a note about /usr/local/bin permissions.  This closes issue #65.

  * Added files describing possible install methods (INSTALL), and possible 
    build commands (Makefile).

  * The syntax that was used to specify the version of the lxml dependency 
    ('>=') is not supported in python distutil setup.py files, and caused setup 
    to try to find an lxml version greater than =2.2.8, which couldn't succeed. 
    Fixed to say '>2.2.7' instead.  This was probably the cause of always 
    reinstalling lxml even when it was present.

  * Updated README.rst to cover the new --date option, and tweaked it a bit.

  * Added some files to provide an enhanced source distribution package.

  * Updated setup.py with maintainer and licence information.

xml2rfc (2.3.10) ietf; urgency=low

  * Changed the output text for Internet-Draft references to omit the 
    series name, but add (work in progress).  Updated the test case to match 
    draft revision number.

  * Updated all the rfc editor boilerplate in valid test facits to match the 
    correct outcome (which is also what the code actually produces).

  * Changed the diff test error message so that the valid text is output as 
    the original, not as the changed text of a diff.

  * Corrected test cases to match correct expiry using 185 days instead of 
    183 days from document date.

  * Added missing attributes to the XmlRfcError Exception subclass, 
    necessary in order to make it resemble lxml's error class and provide 
    consistent error messages to the user whether they come from lxml or our 
    own code.

  * Added a licence file, indicating the licencing used by the IETF for the 
    xml2rfc code.

  * Fixed up the xml2rfc cli script to provide better help texts by telling 
    the option parser the appropriate option variable names.

  * Fixed up the help text formatting by explicitly providing an appropriate
    help text formatter to the option parser.  

  * Added an option (--date=DATE)to provide the document date on the command
    line.

  * Added an option (--no-dtd) to disable the DTD validation step.  

  * Added code to catch additional exceptions and provide appropriate user
    information, instead of an exception traceback.
