Building xml2rfc GUI application on Windows
===========================================

Pre-build requirements
----------------------

    - Install python 2.6 or higher
    - Ensure that the following directories are on your system PATH
	    - \Python27  (or appropriate version) 
	    - \Python27\Scripts (or appropriate version)
    - Install Visual Studio 2008 express
    - Install pywin32
    - Install PyQt4 binary for windows
    - Install setuptools for windows
    - Install LXML 2.3 through easy_install command:
        $ easy_install lxml==2.3

Building
--------

    Run "make.bat"

    The output of this script is an application directory in build/dist. This directory
    can be zipped and distributed as a standalone executable.

    Additionally, you can build an MSI installer at this point (the make.bat prompt 
    tells you to do this).  Open vs2008/setup/setup.vdproj and hit "Build".  The built
    MSI file goes in "dist".

    You can clean up build files by running "clean.bat"
